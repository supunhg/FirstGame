# My First Game 🎮

A 2D platformer game built with Godot Engine - my very first game development project!

## 🎯 About

This is my first attempt at game development, inspired by the excellent [Brackeys tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0) on Godot for beginners. After always wanting to make games but never knowing where to start, this tutorial gave me the confidence to finally dive in!

The game features a knight character navigating through platforms, collecting coins, avoiding enemies, and discovering secrets. There's even a hidden easter egg waiting to be found! 🎪

## 🚀 Features

- **Character Movement**: Smooth platformer controls with jumping mechanics
- **Collectibles**: Coin collection system with sound effects
- **Enemies**: Green and purple slimes to avoid
- **Environmental Hazards**: Killzones and obstacles
- **Audio**: Background music and sound effects for actions
- **Hidden Content**: Secret easter egg (try to find it without cheating!)

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Use arrow keys or WASD to move your knight character
2. Jump to navigate platforms and avoid enemies
3. Collect coins scattered throughout the level
4. Avoid the slimes and environmental hazards
5. See if you can discover the hidden easter egg!
